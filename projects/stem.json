    "body": "A 2024 report released by the Canadian government states that women make up less than 25% of people in STEM careers. In fact, they make up just 23% of Canadians working in science and technology. Do women in STEM notice gender imbalance? YES! Conducting interviews on both men and women in STEM fields, 3 key issues persisted: Feelings of exclusion and isolation in women, lack of female representation, and prevalence of discriminatory gender stereotypes. These gender workshop materials are crafted to inspire meaningful, collaborative discussions about gender in STEM fields, focusing on the key themes identified in interviews.",
